Google Santa Tracker for Web
============================

This repository contains the code to [Google Santa Tracker](https://santatracker.google.com), an educational and entertaining tradition for the December holiday period.
It is a companion to the [Android](https://github.com/google/santa-tracker-android) app.

If you'd like to learn more about the engineering that goes into Santa Tracker, and how Santa Tracker works offline as a Progressive Web App, please check out [Santa Tracker as a PWA](https://developers.google.com/web/showcase/2017/santa).

## Changes

In the 2016 version of Santa Tracker, some featured changes include-

* Upgrade to use Polymer 1.7
* Santa is a Progressive Web App supporting Add to Home Screen and offline through Service Worker
* Further streamlined Chromecast support
* Support the [Web Share API](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/10/navigator-share) where available
* Added several new games, including Gift Matcher, Code a Snowflake and Wrap Battle

# Supports

Santa Tracker supports Chrome, Firefox, and Edge; it also supports IE11, Safari 9+ and Chromium-based browsers (Opera, Samsung etc) at m44 or above.

# Usage

## Prerequisites

You'll need `npm`, `bower` (use `npm install -g bower` if it's missing) and Java available on your system.

## Setup

Clone project, then from within the repo:

```bash
$ npm install
```

For a list of commands, run `gulp --help`.

## Build and run

Build and run with `gulp serve`.
This will serve from the root directory and recompile JavaScript or CSS on watched changes.
The first build might take some time (~10-20m), as it compiles every scene.

You can load scenes (even while locked) via their ID, e.g. at `/#codeboogie`.
Alternatively, unlock houses (in dev) by calling `santaApp.unlockAllHouses()`.

If you'd like to serve another way, then you can build all development dependencies with `gulp`.

## Serve production build

First, build for prod and set a `baseurl` for static assets:

    gulp dist --baseurl="http://localhost:9000/"

Serve prod:

    serve -p 3000 dist_prod/

Separately, serve the static resources:

    serve -p 9000 --cors dist_static/

Open http://localhost:3000/.

## Release

Use `gulp dist --pretty` to build.
This performs additional steps, such as vulcanizing code and internationalization.
Serve from `./dist_pretty`.

## Portal Docker deployment

* Checkout / update any dependent repos
* Build the image: `docker build -t santa .`
* Create the container: `docker create --restart always -p 8080:8080 --name santa santa`
* Run the container: `docker start -d santa`
* Verify that the container is running: `docker ps`
* Verify that the container is listening: `curl -I http://lg-head:8080`

To rebuild, run `docker rm -f santa` and start over from building the image.

# Scenes

Santa Tracker is comprised shared code along with many individual scenes: e.g., `village`, `tracker` etc.

## Relevant Paths

Scenes are referenced in a few locations-

* `scenes.js`: The definition for each scene is contained here.
  If an `entryPoint` is specified, then the scene is compiled with the Closure Compiler.
  This is also used as the reference for the HTML fanout, creating a HTML file per scene, per language.
* `images/og`: The OG image (for sharing) in the form `images/og/sceneName.png`, and have a resolution of 1333x1000.
* `images/scenes`: Each scene should have two images, the centered and resized version of the OG image-
  1. a 950x564 2x image: `images/scenes/sceneName_2x.png`
  1. a 475x282 1x image: `images/scenes/sceneName.png`
* `elements/santa-strings.html`: Due to inconsistent scene i18n message IDs, each scene needs to have its name declared here for dynamic string loading at runtime.

There are two optional locations-

* `scenes/dorf/sass/_houses.scss`: If the scene is also a _house_ that lives in the village.
* `scenes/press/js/models.js`: To be included in the Press and Educators scenes.
